# Movies-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
I perform exploratory data analysis on a large dataset related to movies in Python

I am new to the Python environment, so I wanted to practice a bit with a fun dataset. 

I am a big fan of movies, so I wanted to work with something I am familiar with.

I worked with a large dataset pertaining to movies. 

The dataset has ~7700 rows & ~15 columns of information, pertaining to movie titles, directors, IMDB score, gross revenues, etc. 

I mostly utilized the Pandas, Seaborn, and Numpy libraries respectively. 

I mostly explore correlation metrics among variables & perform related statistical tests.

I also produced visualizations to analyze the relationships through heatmaps & simple regression methods.
